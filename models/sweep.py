SWEEP MODEL: back-and-forth signature + coverage regularity
==========================================================

A different way to find lawnmower surveys, built for coarse tracks such as
Global Fishing Watch's hourly, ~1 km-snapped positions.

The baseline looks for long, straight lines first (it needs several fixes per
line) and then chains neighbouring lines. On hourly data a 20 km survey line
may be only two or three fixes, and the turns fall between fixes, so straight
lines are hard to see and short random back-and-forth (a patrol, a ship working
a small spot) can still chain into "blocks".

This model works the other way round:

1. HEADING SIGNATURE. In a sliding window (24 h of track, or 25 fixes when there
   are no timestamps) it measures how the ship's movement is spread over
   directions. Two numbers, both 0..1:
     axial strength       R2 = how much of the movement lies along ONE axis
                                (either way along it)
     directional strength R1 = how much of the movement goes ONE way
   Transit: R1 high. Circling or loitering: R2 low. Lawnmower: R2 high and R1
   low, i.e. back and forth along one axis. Windows with that signature make
   up a candidate survey episode.
2. LEGS. Inside an episode, each run of fixes heading the same way along the
   axis is one leg. A leg can be one hourly step long; it needs no straightness
   test, so gently curved lines (following depth contours) still count.
3. COVERAGE REGULARITY. A real survey covers ground systematically: legs of
   similar length, side by side, evenly spaced, stepping across the area. A
   group of legs only becomes a survey block if
     - the spacing between neighbouring legs is in range (not ~0: a ship
       shuttling along the same line is not mapping new ground),
     - the spacing is regular (low variation),
     - the legs overlap and have similar lengths,
     - the legs step across the area mostly one way, or cover it evenly.
     - each turn shifts the ship across by about one line spacing (a zig-zag
       of V shapes, where each leg starts where the last ended, is not a survey;
       on hourly data, where the turn can fall between fixes, legs that share
       the corner fix must instead run within 8 degrees of exactly opposite),
     - the legs do not cross each other,
     - neighbouring legs stay about as far apart at the far end as at the turn
       (no fans),
     - there are at least 5 legs over at least 12 hours.
   Patrols, which go back and forth over the same strip at irregular offsets,
   fail here.

The blocks then go through the same scoring, survey-area grouping and next-line
prediction as the baseline, so the map, tables and downloads are unchanged.

Good at:  hourly / sparse AIS (GFW, satellite AIS with gaps); curved lines;
          rejecting patrols and shuttles; finding sustained survey campaigns.
Weaker:   very short surveys (under ~a day of back-and-forth); single lines and
          cross-lines on their own; star, spiral or radial patterns; surveys run
          by an AUV or towed sled while the ship itself barely moves (no model
          that only reads the ship's track can see those).
